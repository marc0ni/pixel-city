# pixel-city -- a Flickr viewer
This is another project from Udemy online university's course <i>iOS 11 & Swift 4: From Beginning to Paid Professional</i>. The app incorporates iOS' MapKit framework, using pin annotations to activate a pop view of photographs associated with a specific point on the map. Further, it also uses the Alamofire pod to make web requests from the Flickr web site and the Alamofire Image pod to retrieve those photos for use in a UICollectionView on the app.

Instead of using a secondary modal view, this app employs a single view controller that holds both (a) the Map view and (b) a pop-up subview. When a pin is dropped on the map, the height measurement of the subview is animated to cover the lower portion of the map and display a UICollectionView of photos from that location. A downward swipe dismisses the subview.

Because in its default state the pop-up is only 1 pixel high, the subview is mostly built programmatically. The only aspects of the subview used in the IB are its abutment to the map view, its constraints, and its height dimension. The height dimension is linked to the MapVC code through an IBOutlet, allowing the view controller to animate that dimension of the subview.
